# Front-end
->I designed the complete web page from the scratch using HTML and CSS

-> I also added a change theme feature using **javascript** by which we can change the theme of the website from light mode to dark mode and vice-versa
js file - script/pet_adoption.js

-> Before thet, I designed the whole website using figma, the link of that is mentioned below.
